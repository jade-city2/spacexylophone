         It's actually been like this for a while, but to change this, you need to do something about it.
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>It all started back in 2000 when Google launched AdWords. At first, it was just text-based ads alongside search results. Today, AdWords has rebranded as Google Ads, with a focus on monetization of data through personalized ads rather than trying to become better.</p>

        <h3>Where does Google get most of its revenue?</h3>
        <p>According to Finshots.in, as indicated by the chart below, it's clear where Google's money comes from. Although this is 2019 data, the proportions have remained similar. Combining ads on its own properties and network members, advertising makes up 74% of Google's revenue.</p>

        <h3>Data & Privacy</h3>
        <p>Google collects a significant amount of your data, which is put through an ad bidding process between companies competing for your attention. Google uses your data to target ads, giving advertisers access to you without ever handing over your raw information. (Handing over raw data directly would likely be illegal.)</p>

        <h3>It only gets worse from there</h3>
        <p>Google was founded in 1998, and ads began in 2000. Chrome launched in 2008 and, due to its features, now holds around 70% of the browser market share. According to a study by Surfshark, Chrome was the only browser that collected financial information (through autofill if you allow it) and collected lists of contact information.</p>

        <h2>Change Chrome Settings</h2>
        <p>If you still prefer Chrome, you can adjust your privacy settings. However, data will still be collected—just less of it. Go to <code>chrome://settings</code> and open the Privacy section. You can configure the settings to your preference from there.</p>

        <h2>Alternatives</h2>
        <p>You can use different search engines like DuckDuckGo and different browsers like Firefox and Brave. DuckDuckGo even has its own browser.</p>
